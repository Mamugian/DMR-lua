# Dank Memes Revolution - A mobile game about memes for iOS and Android
My way of learning LUA using Corona SDK by making a game with memes. 
I wanted to learn some LUA for a long time (back in 2017) and what's more fun than learning something by making a game? 
Well, making a game with memes of course. That was the time where memes on instagram went banans and i took the opportunity to make a 
game about it. I also got the chance to monetize it, but don't even ask how much i made please. 
Corona was usedjust as framework as 100% of the code is made in LUA.

About Corona: Corona is a cross-platform framework ideal for rapidly creating apps and games for mobile devices and desktop systems. 
That means you can create your project once and publish it to multiple types of devices, including Apple iPhone and iPad, Android phones and tablets, 
Amazon Fire, Mac Desktop, Windows Desktop, and even connected TVs such as Apple TV, Fire TV, and Android TV.
